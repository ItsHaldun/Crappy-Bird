# Crappy-Bird
A Flappy Bird copy I made to learn p5.js

It is the second time I used OOP other than as a gimmick or part of a tutorial, so I expect that there can be significant improvements. 

## What are These Files:
- index.js and style.css: Webpage configurated by Processing.
- p5.js and p5.sound.min.js: What makes Processing work.
- sketch.js: Main logic of the game that updates things every frame.
- bird.js: Class that is rendered to screen as red square as default. It is the player character.
- pipe.js: Class responsible for creating and drawing one single pipe section.
- pipeColumn.js: Class that contains two pipes with a gap between them.
- pipeList.js: Class that contains numerous pipeColumns and continually adds/removes them as the game progresses.

## How to Use the Code:
- Just upload the documents to p5.js web editor.

*Or*

- Using LiveServer from VSCode, you can run index.html on your browser.

*Or*

- Whatever works for you.

## How to Play:
- Click mouse to start.
- Keep clicking mouse to flap the birds wings. It is not very good at flying and needs encouragement.
- Avoid green pipes.
- Upon death, reload the page, because past me did the current me like that.
