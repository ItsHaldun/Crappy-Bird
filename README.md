# Crappy-Bird
A Flappy Bird copy I made to learn p5.js

It is the second time I used OOP other than as a gimmick or part of a tutorial, so I expect that there can be significant improvements. 

## How to Use the Code:
- Just upload the documents to p5.js web editor.

*Or*

- Using LiveServer from VSCode, you can run index.html on your browser.

*Or*

- Whatever works for you.

## How to Play:
- Click mouse to start.

- Keep clicking mouse to flap the birds wings. It is not very good at flying and needs encouragement.

- Avoid green pipes.

- Upon death, reload the page, because past me did the current me like that.
